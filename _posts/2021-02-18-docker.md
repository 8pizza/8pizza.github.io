## docker
 Packaging applications, deploying containers (applications) and running them (as long as you want, anytime, anywhere)
 
### needs
 - When components are modified or changed for compatibility issues, other components should not be affected
 
### work
 - Each component runs in a separate container
 - Each service can be run according to its dependencies in individual containers
 - Once you configure Docker, all developers can use it without having to do the same thing
 
### use
 - Most easy-to-use applications are already containerized, and you can find necessary images on docker hub, etc.
 - After installing docker on the desired host, execute the docker run command with the image name
 - You can add and run as many instances as you need
 
### dev/ops
 - Developer develops -> delivers to operation team -> distributes and manages operation team
 - ASIS : Delivering the operation guide along with the application  Problems always arise (Either the environment is different.. People are the problem..)
 - Use a Dockerfile instead of a guide: instead of a guide for a requirement, process the requirement by making it an image
 - Ensures it runs the same way everywhere  Deploys programs using images
